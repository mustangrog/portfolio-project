    <!--Generally, you should only have one <h1> per page.  You should keep your heading tags 'in order'.  And never use heading tags to 'style' your text.
      -->
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <h2>This is an even smaller header</h2>
    <h3>Even smaller...</h3>
    <h6>Quite small</h6>
    <p>Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!</p>

    <p><em>This is the emphasis tag that will usually render italics</em></p>

    <p><i>This text is in italics. We don't typically use this tag any longer.  However, we would use it when we want to italicize WITHOUT giving additional emphasis.  An example of this when mentioning the title of an article. Like in bibliography</i></p>

    <p><strong>This strong tag is for BOLD</strong></p>

    <p><b>This text is in bold. This tag is just for making thing written in BOLT as per some language arts.</b></p>
    <p><b><i>This text is in both.</i></b></p>
    <p><del>This text is rendered with strikethrough.</del></p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
    <p>You could BREAK

      <!--We should pretty much only use <br> when the line break is actually a part of the content - such as in a mailing address or in a powem-->

      <!--<address> tag is not just for mailing addresses. It's anything that's considered to contain information for the author of the page.-->
