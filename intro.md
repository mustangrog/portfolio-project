## I am learning to code at SavvyCoders!

### I'm currently learning Mark Down

This here is a normal paragraph.  I'm just typing stuff to fill up some space.  blah, blah, blah!

_This is an example of my type in italics._

**This text is an example of me typing in Bold**

**_This is me typing in both bold and italic._**

~~This is text I didn't mean to type!~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\*
right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!

Things I have learned so far....

- Bash Commands
- GIT Commands
- MarkDown


Another three items I'll learn....

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
